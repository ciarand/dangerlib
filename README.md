RPC server in Go
----------------
This is a simple JSON-RPC server / client written in Go that allows the client
to perform arbitrary commands on the server side by passing them through a Unix
socket.

*This is incredibly unsafe and dangerous. Do not run this unless you know what
you're doing.*

For a working example, see [dangercli][].
